ip-services
============

  An example spark application to demonstrate the exercise of importing a 
file and saving to a hive table and using Scala Pattern Matching for effective parsing. 

  In this example, we use the common IP Services as defined on unix systems 
in '/etc/services'.  This is a tab-delimited 4 column file with comments and 2 of 
the 4 columns being optional.
