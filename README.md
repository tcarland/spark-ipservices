spark-ipservices
================

  An example spark application to demonstrate the exercise of
importing a file and saving to a hive table. This demonstrates
using Scala Pattern Matching for effective parsing.

  For this example, we use the IP Services file as defined
on all unix systems in '/etc/services'.  This is a tab-delimited four
column file with comments and 2 of the 4 columns being optional.
